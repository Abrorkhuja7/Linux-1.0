# Linux-1.0
## S21 - UNIX/Linux Operating Systems (Basic)
This project focuses on gaining hands-on experience with Linux system administration using Ubuntu 20.04 Server (no GUI) in a virtualized environment. The work covers OS installation, user and permission management, network configuration (DHCP and static IP), system updates, and secure access via SSH.
Key administrative tools and services were configured and analyzed, including time synchronization, cron jobs, system logs, disk and memory utilities (df, du, ncdu, top, htop), and text editors (Vim, Nano, others).
The project emphasizes practical DevOps fundamentals: working entirely from the terminal, understanding system processes, monitoring resources, and documenting results clearly using Markdown reports with evidence and explanations.
